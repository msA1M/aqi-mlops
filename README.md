🌍 AQI Prediction System — End-to-End MLOps Project
An end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) project for Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction, monitoring, and alerting.
The system demonstrates realistic industry-style MLOps practices, including live data ingestion, experiment tracking, model registry, explainability, drift monitoring, orchestration, CI/CD, and containerized deployment.

🎯 Project Objective
To build a production-style ML system that:
Predicts AQI using historical air-quality data
Classifies air quality into health-based categories
Monitors live environmental data for drift
Provides alerts when air quality degrades
Ensures reliability via automation, testing, and CI/CD

🧠 System Capabilities
✅ Engineering & Machine Learning
Historical AQI data ingestion (time-series)
Feature store with lag & rolling statistics
Multiple ML models (Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost)
MLflow experiment tracking & model registry
Best-model selection and registration
SHAP explainability for model transparency
AQI category classification & alert logic
🌐 Live Data Integration
Live air-quality ingestion from OpenAQ
Robust fallback mechanism when external API is unavailable
Live data used for monitoring & drift detection (not blind prediction)
📈 Monitoring & Reliability
Data drift detection and visualization
Alert triggering based on AQI category
Automated ML tests (data, model performance, inference)
⚙️ Systems & Ops
FastAPI inference service
Streamlit interactive dashboard
Prefect orchestration for end-to-end pipelines
Docker & Docker Compose for deployment
GitHub Actions CI pipeline (tests + Docker builds)
Clean project structure & .gitignore

🚀 How to Run (Local)
1️⃣ Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Train models & register best model
python training/train_regression_models.py
python training/select_and_register_best_model.py

3️⃣ Run FastAPI
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

4️⃣ Run Streamlit UI
streamlit run ui/app.py
🐳 Docker Deployment
docker compose build
docker compose up
FastAPI → http://localhost:8000/docs
Streamlit → http://localhost:8501
MLflow artifacts are mounted at runtime, not baked into images.

🔁 Orchestration (Prefect)
python pipelines/prefect_flow.py
Or (optional UI):
prefect server start

🧪 Automated ML Tests
pytest tests/
Tests cover:
Data schema & quality
Model performance regression
Inference safety

🔄 CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
On every push to main:
Dependencies installed
ML tests executed
Docker images built
Ensures reproducibility & reliability.

⚠️ Design Decisions (Important)
Live OpenAQ data is used for monitoring, not direct training
Training and inference are decoupled
Retraining is not automatic — triggered by drift signals
Docker images are artifact-agnostic (CI-safe)
